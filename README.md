# Typescript, NestJS, and Angular

These materials are designed to help you gain real-world proficiency with
projects that use Typescript, NestJS, and Angular.

[First, watch the introductory video.](https://youtu.be/JO7JguGd11I)

Next, you may work through the [`01_typescript/`](01_typescript) directory to
get started with the Typescript, unless you know it already.

After this, work on the project below.

> # Real-time Crypto Prices using NestJS and Angular
> 
> Task: Create a client/server that provides a real time price stream for the
> following coins [BTC,ETH,XRP,LTC,BCH,ETC] and their value in the following
> currencies [USD,GBP,EUR,JPY,ZAR].
> 
> The project must be hosted on Github or Gitlab and CryptoCompare must be used
> as the data source.
> 
> Requirements:
> * Server: NestJS
> * Client: Angular
> * Testing
>
> Nice to haves:
> * History
> * Filters
> * WebSockets

There is a seed codebase in `02_nestjs` and `03_angular` to get you started and
videos talking through the key points of the codebase
[here](#introduction--walkthrough-video).

## Seed Project Setup

```shell
; cd 02_nestjs               # For the backend
; npm install -g @nestjs/cli # Install the NestJS CLI
; npm install                # Install dependencies
; code .env                  # Add the API key according to instructions
; npm run test               # Run unit tests
; npm run test:e2e           # Run end-to-end integration tests
; npm run start
# Server will start, to verify visit http://localhost:3000/price?from=BTC&to=USD
```

```shell
# In a new terminal
; cd 03_angular               # For the frontend
; npm install -g @angular/cli # Install the Angular CLI
; npm install                 # Install dependencies
; npm run test                # Run the tests (in Chrome)
; npm run start
# Server will start, to verify visit http://localhost:4200/
```

## Things you'll need to learn

Here's a list of things that are important to learn to be proficient in this
stack. You can use it to keep track of your learning, and avoid getting
side-tracked by less important things.

There are a lot of things here and there's no expectation you learn all of this
in any period of time. The key thing is to stay focused and make progress. Check
in with your coach if you are unsure.
